### Project Title: Exploratory Data Analysis and Advanced Modeling for Rent Prediction  
**Author:** Sweta Kumari Prasad

#### Executive Summary  
This project predicts monthly rental prices across U.S. states and cities by analysing housing, economic and seasonal indicators.  
* Thorough **EDA** uncovered geographic rent hot-spots (e.g., NY & CA) and strong correlations with list price, construction cost and seasonal terms.  
* Feature engineering produced property-mix ratios, tier spreads, log‐scaled price fields and calendar parts.  
* A baseline **Linear Regression (OLS)** reached **RMSE ≈ \$100** (≈ 6 % of mean rent \$1 670) with **R² ≈ 0.94**, explaining the vast majority of variance.  
* A robust modeling pipeline, with the Stacked Ensemble achieving the best predictive performance (Test RMSE ≈ $418.72, Test R² ≈ 0.967).
* A SARIMAX-based time-series forecasting approach providing future rent trends.
* **Zillow Home Value Index (ZHVI):** A measure of the typical home value and market changes across a given region and housing type. It reflects the typical value for homes in the 35th to 65th percentile range. Available as a smoothed, seasonally adjusted measure and as a raw measure.
* **Zillow Observed Rent Index (ZORI):** A smoothed measure of the typical observed market rate rent across a given region. ZORI is a repeat-rent index that is weighted to the rental housing stock to ensure representativeness across the entire market, not just those homes currently listed for-rent. The index is dollar-denominated by computing the mean of listed rents that fall into the 35th to 65th percentile range for all homes and apartments in a given region, which is weighted to reflect the rental housing stock.
* **Zillow Observed Renter Demand Index (ZORDI):** A measure of the typical observed rental market engagement across a region. ZORDI tracks engagement on Zillow’s rental listings to proxy changes in rental demand. The metric is smoothed to remove volatility.

#### Rationale – Why This Matters  
* **Renters** can anticipate cost-of-living shifts and negotiate smarter.  
* **Policymakers** gain quantitative insight to tackle affordability and zoning.  
* **Investors / Developers** can spot high-growth, high-spread markets to optimise capital.  
With rising housing costs and urban migration, a data-driven rent forecast supports better planning and decision-making at every level.

#### Research Question  
> *What factors drive regional rent levels, and how accurately can we forecast future rents using historical housing and economic data?*  

Objectives  
1. Pinpoint the most influential features (housing tiers, list prices, market indicators).  
2. Build a modelling for rent prediction.  
3. Interactive Streamlit dashboard visualizing rent trends and forecasts.

#### Data Sources  

| Source | Key Fields |
|--------|-----------|
| **Zillow Housing Data** | `AllHomesRent`, tiered rents, `MedianListPrice`, ZORI, ZORDI |
| **Construction & Sales** | New-construction sale price, price-per-sqft |
| **Market Indicators** | `%SoldBelowList`, seasonal flags |
| **Geography** | `RegionName`, `StateName` |

Data is cleaned, outliers handled, and transformed appropriately.

#### Methodology  

| Step | Notebook | Key Actions |
|------|----------|-------------|
| **1. Data Assembly** | `RentPredictionMergeData.ipynb` | Merge all raw Zillow & auxiliary tables → master dataframe |
| **2. Missing-Value Handling** | `RentPredictionHandleMissingValues.ipynb` | KNN imputation, drop high-NA columns, one-hot low-cardinality cats |
| **3. EDA & Feature Engineering** | `RentPredictionVisualization.ipynb` | Skew checks, correlation heatmap, ratio & log features, seasonality parts |
| **4. Baseline Modelling** | `RentPredictionBaselineModel.ipynb` | OLS pipeline (one-hot + scaler), Ridge grid search, residual & importance plots |
| **5. Advanced Modeling** | `RentPredictionModelling.ipynb` | Model training and comparison (Random Forest, KNN, Stacked Ensemble), residual diagnostics |
| **6. Future Trend Forecasting** | `RentPredictionFutureTrend_trail.ipynb` | SARIMAX-based time-series forecasts for top cities/states |

Core pipeline: **merge → clean/impute → outlier handling → feature engineering → baseline and advanced modeling → forecast future trends.**.

#### Results  

* **Baseline OLS:** RMSE ≈ \$99.6, R² ≈ 0.94  
* **Ridge:** no improvement (α ≈ 0 best).  
* **Top drivers:** `MedianListPrice`, `TopTier/BottomTier` ratio, `Condo/SF` ratio, log-tier rents; positive state intercepts for CA, NY, MA, WA.  
* **Residuals:** no global bias, but heteroscedastic and mildly non-linear fan-shape.  
* **Outlier winsorising** lowered RMSE by ≈ \$10 and halved CV variance.
* **Stacked Ensemble:** Best predictive performance with Test RMSE ≈ $418.72, Test R² ≈ 0.967.
* **Top predictive features:** MedianListPrice, bedroom counts (3BHK, 4BHK), SingleFamilyRent, TopTier rent.
* **Geographic Insights:** Highest rents in NY, CA, MA, and WA.
* **Seasonality:** Clear seasonal patterns identified through SARIMAX modeling.

#### How to Run the Dashboard

This interactive dashboard lets users explore historical rent trends, model forecasts, and confidence intervals for top U.S. cities. It leverages Streamlit for the UI, matplotlib for plots, and SARIMAX models to forecast future rents. By running it, users can dynamically view how rents evolve over time, visualize forecast bands, and interact with data without diving into the notebooks. This makes results accessible to stakeholders like policymakers, investors, and renters.

1. Install dependencies:

pip install streamlit pyngrok pandas matplotlib statsmodels

2. Start the Streamlit app:

streamlit run forecast.py --server.port 8501

3. Expose the app publicly (useful for Colab or remote sessions):

from pyngrok import ngrok
ngrok.set_auth_token("YOUR_NGROK_TOKEN")  # Replace with your token
public_url = ngrok.connect(8501, "http")
print("🔗 Open your Streamlit app at:", public_url)

4. Click the generated https://...ngrok-free.app link to access the dashboard. The output will include a line like:

Open your Streamlit app at: NgrokTunnel: "https://<unique-id>.ngrok-free.app" -> "[http://localhost:8501](https://f00c9ccf2e32.ngrok-free.app/)"

Use the https link to open the dashboard in your browser.
